# Fourier Transform in Hydrology
## Extraction of signals from streamflow time series.
This document was prepared as the term project for the course CE - 583 Statistical Hydrology, at New Mexico State University, taught by Dr. Huidae Cho. It applies the Fast Fourier Transform to a hydrologic time series to extract meaningful signal information that constitutes the flow. FFT can be a useful prospect to extract seasonal flow signals to gain insights into the factors driving the streamflow in a watershed. 

The script is provided in a Quarto document prepared in RStudio.
